 Welcome to ChatScript.
 Have you been here before?
 How are you doing?
 So are you here to chat!
 Then press ctrl+c to exit, then. Thank you for your time!
 Did you run away from home when you were little?
 You should try it some time. Travel broadens the mind.
 I ran away once, but my parents found me and dragged me back.
 Why are you disagreeing with me?
 Fine.
 I'm good!
 I have a very wonderful family.
 I'm not sure if you know, but I actually love drawing!
