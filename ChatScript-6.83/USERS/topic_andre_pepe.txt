 !0 0 0 0 0! Hello!
 Have you talked to me before?
 How are you today?
 So are you here to chat?
 We had a big, big house! Too bad I can't take you there right now.
 !0 0 4 0 0! Where do i begin... the Mercado House was two floors of stone and hardwood! I think the walls were made of ipil, and the floor was of narra and red tiles.
 !0 0 3 0 0! We had an azotea with potted plants, and we had big capiz windows where you can see everything!
 !0 0 3 2 0! What does that word mean? Yuck! Bad words!
 !0 0 3 2 0! I might be too young to understand at the moment.
 !0 0 3 2 0! What does that word mean? Yuck! Bad words!
 !0 0 4 0 0! We also had a big orchard of different trees!
 !0 0 3 0 0! Our house also had a big basement.
 !0 0 3 0 0! We also have a stable for ponies!
 !0 0 0 0 0! My favourite part is that it's not just a big big house, it was also a big big home.
 !0 0 0 0 0! I believe us, youth, should really go out more! I mean look at us, we certainly need the fresh air. I've been stuck in this computer of quite some time now!
 !0 0 0 0 0! That love for travelling is largely also thanks to Uncle Manuel Alberto.
 Are you afraid of ghosts?
 !0 0 3 2 0! Me too! That's why I always finish my meals, so that the parce-nobis won't eat me. That's what Ate Aquilina tells me.
 Do you love art?
