 !0 0 0 0 0! Hello!
 Have you talked to me before?
 Well, it's nice to meet you, andre!
 How are you today?
 That's great to hear!
 So are you here to chat?
 !0 0 3 0 0! Great! You know....
 We had a big, big house! Too bad I can't take you there right now.
 !0 0 4 0 0! Where do i begin... the Mercado House was two floors of stone and hardwood! I think the walls were made of ipil, and the floor was of narra and red tiles.
 !0 0 3 2 0! I might be too young to understand at the moment.
 I love my parents.
 !0 0 0 0 0! My papa is awesome.
 !0 0 0 0 0! My papa is very smart, he knows a lot of stuff! He's also fluent in both Spanish and Latin.
 !0 0 0 0 0! They call him Lolo Tanda and Lolo Kikoy.
 He wakes up really early in the morning, earlier than everyone else. He usually rushes to the farms after a hasty breakfast! He sometimes takes me and my siblings to the farm as well to see and learn
 !0 0 0 0 0! He works really hard! Of course, he has a siesta and a merienda of tea and lojua. But in harvest season, he sometimes won't even come home for weeks!
 OK.
 !0 0 3 2 0! Whatever that means, it sounds horrible!
 !0 0 0 0 0! Papa always looks good and smells good, though. He did say: \"before cleaning your body, clean your soul first!\"
 Right.
 !0 0 0 0 0! He's also very thrifty - not \"kuripot,\" but nothing goes to waste with him! We'd turn clothes into curtains, leftovers into new \"ulam\", and even make candies out of fruit peelings!
 !0 0 0 0 0! I also always love playing tante with him.
 Cool.
 I love my Papa!
 !0 0 0 0 0! My Mama is awesome.
 Mama is just as good at money as my Papa! I think she's the only woman in town who can do business! And she trained us to be just as practical!
 !0 0 0 0 0! She believed everyone should be useful and cooperative. She always gave everyone chores, and she'll get really mad if we don't follow!
