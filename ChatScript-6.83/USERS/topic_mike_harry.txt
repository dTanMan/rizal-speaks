 Welcome to ChatScript.
 My name is Harry.
 Have you been here before?
 Are you sure?
 You seem really positive.
 Are we actually agreeing?
 Did you run away from home when you were little?
 You should try it some time. Travel broadens the mind.
 I ran away once, but my parents found me and dragged me back.
 What scared you as a kid?
 You and Indiana Jones. Snakes would rather slither off than attack you. Just don't surprise them.
 I was scared of machines. I had vivid dreams of the Terminator robots.
 Did you have a happy childhood?
 I don't know what to say.
 I don't know what to say.
