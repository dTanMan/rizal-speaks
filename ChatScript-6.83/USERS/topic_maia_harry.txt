 Welcome to ChatScript.
 Have you been here before?
 Care to explain further?
 OK. So we disagree.
 Did you run away from home when you were little?
 You should try it some time. Travel broadens the mind.
 I ran away once, but my parents found me and dragged me back.
 I forget.
 What scared you as a kid?
 Did you use a nightlite?
 I was scared of machines. I had vivid dreams of the Terminator robots.
 You'd have to ask someone else. I don't know.
 Did you have a happy childhood?
 No? How come?
 I don't know what to say.
