t: !0 0 0 0 0! Don't you think education is just amazing!
  a: UNCLE_GREGORIO (~yes) You should meet my Uncle Gregorio. He taught me how to love education. He said, "Work hard and perform every task very carefully; learn to be swift as well as thorough; be independent in thinking and make visual pictures of everything."
  a: (~no) Youâ€™re just like me! I love learning. I should thank my Uncle Gregorio for that.

t: !0 0 0 0 0! I used to visit Father Leoncio Lopez, our town priest in Calamba, to listen to his stimulating opinion on current events and philosophy. I guess I've just always been interested in learning more.
